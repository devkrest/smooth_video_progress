Have you been there before: you created a video player using [video_player](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player),
but the progress bar updates way to infrequently and makes your UX look choppy?

Look no further than this package. It will make your video progress bars look smooooth âœ¨

## Features

- Build a smoothly interpolated progress bar for [video_player](https://pub.dev/packages/video_player)'s ``VideoPlayerController`` instances.

- Use it for progress bars, spinners, more accurate time displays, ...
## Getting started

Install the package. This package depends on [flutter_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks), because I use it for everything
anyway, check out the package if you don't know it, it makes life so much easier.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
